//the name of this file is experimental. 
//statisitcal packages exist, those will be used
//we will customize some statistical computations,
//and may be encode some statmech models as well!
//so this should be about statmech models, and
//extracting statistics out of them.
//and it should be about programming
//programming wise, a model should be easy to express
//the program itself should provide terminology, or a 
//language to express that model. lets try to do
//this in scala.
